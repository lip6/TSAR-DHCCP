# Promela Models

These models are described in the [report of Mohamad Najem](https://github.com/lip6/TSAR-DHCCP/blob/master/Reports/rapport_final_najem_2011.pdf) for the MN folder and in the [report of Akli Mansour](https://github.com/lip6/TSAR-DHCCP/blob/master/Reports/rapport_final_mansour_2012.pdf) for the AM folder.

In particular, the Annex at the end of M. Najem's report explains the nature of all the variants of the model. Each folder contains a different configuration/variant.

In the AM version, edit the `defs.h` file to set the parameters, then run `plateforme.pml`.

For all of these models, you need [Spin](http://spinroot.com/). The models were mostly analyzed using the graphical front-end of Spin.
